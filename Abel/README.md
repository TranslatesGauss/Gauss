1. GENERAL METHOD FOR FINDING FUNCTIONS OF A SINGLE VARIABLE
QUANTITY, WHEN A PROPERTY OF THESE FUNCTIONS IS GIVEN BY AN
EQUATION IN TWO VARIABLES.
2. SOLUTION OF SOME PROBLEMS WITH THE HELP OF DEFINITE INTEGRALS
3. MEMOIRE ON ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS, IN WHICH THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
SOLVING THE GENERAL EQUATION OF DEGREE FIVE IS DEMONSTRATED
4. A SIMPLE DEFINITE INTEGRAL EXPRESSING THE FINITE INTEGRAL $\Sigma^n{\phi}x$
5. A SMALL CONTRIBUTION TO THE THEORY OF TRANSCENDENTAL FUNCTIONS
6. RESEARCH ON FUNCTIONS OF TWO INDEPENDENT VARIABLES, $f(x, y)$, WITH
THE PROPERTY THAT $f(z, f(x, y))$ IS A SYMMETRIC FUNCTION OF $z$, $x$, AND $y$.
7. DEMONSTRATION OF THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF AN ALGEBRAIC SOLUTION OF
GENERAL EQUATIONS OF DEGREES GREATER THAN FOUR.
