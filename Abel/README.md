1. General method for finding functions of a single variable quantity, when a property of these functions is given by an equation in two variables
2. Solution of some problems with the help of definite integrals
3. Memoire on algebraic equations, in which the impossibility of solving the general equation of degree five is demonstrated.
4. A simple definite integral expressing the finite integral $\Sigma^n{\phi}x$
