Open source translation of Gauss' complete works (very much incomplete at the moment). <br>

Original Latin version (in public domain) can be found <a href="https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN235957348">here</a>. <br>

To contribute, email TranslatesGauss@gmail.com.  I welcome edits, comments on the translation so far, and submissions of (original) translations of new volumes or sections.
