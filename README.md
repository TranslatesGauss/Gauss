Open source translation of Gauss' complete works. So far, the translation is based entirely on google translate and my own understanding of the mathematical content - I can't read Latin. <br>

Original Latin version (in public domain) can be found <a href="https://gdz.sub.uni-goettingen.de/id/PPN235957348">here</a>. <br>

To contribute, email TranslatesGauss@gmail.com.  Contributors with Latin fluency and/or mathematical literacy are especially welcome.
